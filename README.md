## Bitcoin and Lightning payments in Prestashop ##

![Prestashop](https://resources.coinsnap.org/products/prestashop/images/screenshot-prestashop.png)

Coinsnap is a Lightning payment provider and offers a payment gateway for processing Bitcoin and Lightning payments. A merchant only needs a Lightning wallet with a lightning address to accept Bitcoin and Lightning payments on his web store.

In line with the evolving landscape of digital transactions, Coinsnap has developed a complementary plugin that seamlessly enables Bitcoin and Lightning payments via PrestaShop’s robust shop software. The Coinsnap payment plugin was specially developed for PrestaShop and offers merchants a user-friendly interface for optimised Bitcoin payment processing. This innovative module, which is available for free download and installation, integrates seamlessly into the PrestaShop environment. Tested on PrestaShop 1.7+ to 8.1. By using the Coinsnap payment module, PrestaShop shop operators can easily introduce Bitcoin and Lightning payments, expanding their payment options to cater to the different preferences of their customers.

If you would like to experience the Bitcoin and Lightning payment process first-hand in a PrestaShop environment, we invite you to visit our PrestaShop demo shop. Here you can initiate a test order with demo data and seamlessly make payments with Bitcoin and Lightning.

With the Coinsnap Bitcoin Lightning payment processing plugin you can immediately accept Bitcoin Lightning payments on your site. You don’t need your own Lightning node or any other technical requirements if you'd like to provide payments via Coinsnap payment gateway. Coinsnap Bitcoin and Lightning payment requires no minimum costs, no fixed contracts, no hidden costs. The Prestashop payment plugin from Coinsnap can be downloaded and installed free of charge.

Simply register on [Coinsnap](https://app.coinsnap.io/register), enter your own Lightning address, upload and install the Coinsnap payment module in Prestashop backend. Add your store ID and your API key which you’ll find in your Coinsnap account, and your customers can pay you with Bitcoin Lightning right away!
